JavaScript Homework - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

In this assignment we were asked to review UFO data, and build a searchable table using Javascript. There are two folders within this repository and each folder contains an index file, and a static folder.  

In UFO-Level 1, all UFO data is displayed and the user can run a date query to filter the table.

In UFO-Level 2,  all UFO data is displayed and the user can run a multi-parameter query to filter the table.

Dataset was provided for this assignment and can be located within the static folders.
